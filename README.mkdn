Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](https://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the CAF trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/Loup-ROM/android.git -b caf-7.1

Then to sync up:

    repo sync
